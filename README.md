# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Fall 2021)

## What I did

What I basically did was assign sentiment values to different keywords based on a manual search of the text, with 4 different categories of words. One category was for amplification, one was for minimization, one expressed positive sentiment, and the last expressed negative sentiment. Based on whether or not there were specific amplifiers or minimizers, the positive or negative sentiment keywords would be multiplied by said constant, and the script would output a total score.

However, due to personal issues as well as some other time constraints, some of which involved procrastination, I waited until the last minute to do my code, which left me flat-footed and unable to fix some of the bugs that were present in my work. As you read this, I'm ironing out the last few kinks and am slowly trying to fix the remainder of my mistakes. I'm not very experienced in Python, so I'm trying my best to make it work.
